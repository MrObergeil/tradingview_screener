## Project Setup

### Initial Planning (January 2025)

**Decisions Made:**
- Architecture: Python (FastAPI) + TypeScript (Fastify/React) hybrid
- Database: SQLite with better-sqlite3 (added in Phase B, not MVP)
- MVP approach: In-memory first, persistence later
- Development: Direct (no Docker), hot-reload enabled

**Key Documents (in `docs/`):**
- `spec_v2.md` - Full specification with all requirements
- `tv-screener-implementation-plan.md` - Sprint-by-sprint implementation plan
- `progress.txt` - This file (append-only learning log)
- `planner.md` - Planning agent template (reference)

**Workflow:**
- PLAN MODE: Discuss approach before coding
- BUILD MODE: Implement after agreement
- Tests written per task

### Task 1.1: Initialize Project Structure
**Date:** January 2025
**Status:** Completed

**What was done:**
- Created monorepo folder structure: `screener-service/`, `app/`, `docs/`
- Moved all spec/planning files to `docs/` folder
- Created `AGENTS.md` at root with instructions for AI agents
- Created `.gitignore` for Python + Node.js artifacts

**Key Learnings:**
- Keep documentation centralized in `docs/` for easy discovery
- `AGENTS.md` ensures any AI agent reads specs before making changes
- Empty placeholder files (`__init__.py`, `requirements.txt`, `package.json`) help establish structure

**File Locations:**
- Specs and plans: `docs/`
- Python service: `screener-service/src/`
- TypeScript backend: `app/src/server/`
- React frontend: `app/src/client/`

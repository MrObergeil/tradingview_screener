## Project Setup

### Initial Planning (January 2025)

**Decisions Made:**
- Architecture: Python (FastAPI) + TypeScript (Fastify/React) hybrid
- Database: SQLite with better-sqlite3 (added in Phase B, not MVP)
- MVP approach: In-memory first, persistence later
- Development: Direct (no Docker), hot-reload enabled

**Key Documents (in `docs/`):**
- `spec_v2.md` - Full specification with all requirements
- `tv-screener-implementation-plan.md` - Sprint-by-sprint implementation plan
- `progress.txt` - This file (append-only learning log)
- `planner.md` - Planning agent template (reference)

**Workflow:**
- PLAN MODE: Discuss approach before coding
- BUILD MODE: Implement after agreement
- Tests written per task

### Task 1.1: Initialize Project Structure
**Date:** January 2025
**Status:** Completed

**What was done:**
- Created monorepo folder structure: `screener-service/`, `app/`, `docs/`
- Moved all spec/planning files to `docs/` folder
- Created `AGENTS.md` at root with instructions for AI agents
- Created `.gitignore` for Python + Node.js artifacts

**Key Learnings:**
- Keep documentation centralized in `docs/` for easy discovery
- `AGENTS.md` ensures any AI agent reads specs before making changes
- Empty placeholder files (`__init__.py`, `requirements.txt`, `package.json`) help establish structure

**File Locations:**
- Specs and plans: `docs/`
- Python service: `screener-service/src/`
- TypeScript backend: `app/src/server/`
- React frontend: `app/src/client/`

---

### Task 1.2: Implement Python Health Endpoint
**Date:** January 2025
**Status:** Completed

**What was done:**
- Set up devenv at project root (Python 3.11 + Node 20)
- Created FastAPI application with health endpoint
- Added pytest tests for health endpoint

**Files Created:**
- `devenv.nix` - Nix-based dev environment (Python + Node)
- `devenv.yaml` - devenv configuration
- `.envrc` - direnv auto-activation
- `screener-service/src/config.py` - Settings with pydantic-settings
- `screener-service/src/main.py` - FastAPI app entry point
- `screener-service/src/routes.py` - /health endpoint
- `screener-service/tests/test_health.py` - Endpoint tests
- `screener-service/pytest.ini` - Pytest configuration

**Key Learnings:**
- devenv.nix at project root provides unified dev environment for Python + Node
- Use `pydantic-settings` for type-safe configuration from env vars
- FastAPI test client uses `httpx.AsyncClient` with `ASGITransport`
- [!] Remember to add `sys.path` manipulation in tests to import from `src/`

**How to Run:**
```bash
# Enter devenv shell (auto-activates with direnv)
devenv shell

# Or manually:
cd screener-service
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py

# Run tests:
cd screener-service
pytest
```

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /health` - Returns `{"status": "ok", "timestamp": "..."}`

### Task 1.3: Implement /scan Endpoint with tradingview-screener
**Date:** January 2025
**Status:** Completed

**What was done:**
- Created Pydantic models for scan request/response schemas
- Implemented ScreenerService wrapper for tradingview-screener library
- Added /scan endpoint with filter, ordering, pagination support
- Created comprehensive tests with real TradingView API calls

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `screener-service/src/models.py` - Request/response Pydantic models
- `screener-service/src/screener.py` - tradingview-screener wrapper
- `screener-service/src/routes.py` - Added /scan endpoint
- `screener-service/tests/test_scan.py` - Scan endpoint tests (8 tests)
- `screener-service/requirements.txt` - Added tradingview-screener dependency

**Key Learnings:**
- [!] tradingview-screener Column class uses Python comparison operators, NOT methods:
  - CORRECT: `col > value`, `col >= value`, `col == value`
  - WRONG: `col.above(value)`, `col.below(value)`, `col.equal(value)`

- [!] Multiple filters MUST use `where2(And(...))`, NOT chained `.where()` calls:
  - CORRECT: `query.where2(And(condition1, condition2, condition3))`
  - WRONG: `query.where(cond1).where(cond2).where(cond3)` (only applies last filter!)

- Single filter can use `query.where(condition)` directly

- Column methods available: `.between(low, high)`, `.not_between()`, `.isin([])`, `.not_in([])`

- Response fields use aliases for camelCase JSON (e.g., `total_count` → `totalCount`)

**Filter Operators Supported:**
- Comparison: `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `eq`, `neq`
- Range: `between`, `not_between` (require list of 2 values)
- Set: `in`, `not_in` (require list of values)

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /scan` - Execute screener scan
  - Request: `{columns: [...], filters?: [...], orderBy?: {...}, limit?: 50, offset?: 0}`
  - Response: `{totalCount, results, timestamp, durationMs}`

**Tests (8 total, all passing):**
1. `test_scan_basic_columns` - Basic column selection
2. `test_scan_with_filter_gt` - Greater-than filter
3. `test_scan_with_filter_between` - Between filter
4. `test_scan_with_ordering` - Order by field
5. `test_scan_with_multiple_filters` - Multiple filters combined
6. `test_scan_empty_columns_rejected` - Validation error on empty columns
7. `test_scan_invalid_between_value` - Validation error on bad between value
8. `test_scan_response_timing` - Response includes timing metadata

  - CORRECT: `process.env["APP_PORT"]`
  - WRONG: `process.env.APP_PORT`

- Strict TypeScript settings enabled:
  - `noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, `strictFunctionTypes`
  - `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`
  - `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noImplicitReturns`
  - `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`

- tsx (via `tsx watch`) provides fast TypeScript execution without compilation step

**How to Run:**
```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev:server  # Starts on port 3000
npm test            # Run tests
```

**Key Learnings:**
- Fastify routes use async/await pattern naturally
- Error responses must explicitly return reply to satisfy type checker
- Integration tests require both Python and Node services running

**Tests (13 total across Sprint 2):**
- health.test.ts: 2 tests (Node health endpoint)
- screenerClient.test.ts: 6 tests (Python API client)

- Vitest `environmentMatchGlobs` allows different environments per test folder

**How to Run:**
```bash
cd app
npm run dev:client  # Starts Vite on port 5173
npm run dev         # Starts both server and client concurrently
```

**Key Learnings:**
- Frontend API client uses native fetch (simpler than ofetch for client)
- useScreener hook manages loading/error/data state
- Format helpers for numbers, percentages, and volumes
- Color coding for positive/negative changes

**Hook Interface:**
```typescript
interface UseScreenerReturn {
  data: ScanResponse | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  executeScan: (tickers: string[], columns?: string[]) => Promise<void>;
  clearError: () => void;
  clearData: () => void;
}
```

**Tests (25 total across all sprints):**
- Server tests: 13 (health, screenerClient, routes)
- Client tests: 12 (App: 3, TickerInput: 9)

### Sprint 4: Results Table Display
**Date:** January 2025
**Status:** Completed

---

### Task 4.1: Create Results Table Component
**Date:** January 2025
**Status:** Completed

**What was done:**
- Created ResultsTable component with sortable columns
- Added number formatting (price, volume, market cap)
- Color coding for positive/negative changes
- Empty state handling when no results

**Files Created:**
- `app/src/client/components/ResultsTable.tsx` - Results table component
- `app/tests/client/ResultsTable.test.tsx` - Component tests (18 tests)

**Key Learnings:**
- [!] Use `toSorted()` (ES2023) instead of `sort()` for immutable sorting in React
- [!] Must add `"lib": ["ES2023", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"]` to tsconfig.json for toSorted()
- Use `useMemo()` for expensive computations like sorting
- Use `memo()` sparingly - only when props change frequently but render is expensive

**Number Formatting:**
```typescript
// Volume: 52000000 → "52.00M"
// Market Cap: 2850000000000 → "$2.85T"
// Change: 2.34 → "+2.34%"
```

---

### Task 4.2: Add Column Sorting
**Date:** January 2025
**Status:** Completed

**What was done:**
- Added sortable headers with click handlers
- Implemented ascending/descending toggle
- Sort indicators (⇅, ↑, ↓) show current sort state
- Null values sort to bottom

**Key Learnings:**
- Store sort state as `{column: string | null, direction: 'asc' | 'desc'}`
- Click cycles: none → desc → asc → desc → ...
- Null handling: treat nulls as smaller than any value

---

### Task 4.3: Add Basic Filters UI
**Date:** January 2025
**Status:** Completed

**What was done:**
- Created BasicFilters component with price/volume inputs
- Added filter-to-API conversion (buildFilters function)
- Clear filters functionality
- Loading state disables inputs
- Integrated with useScreener hook via setFilters

**Files Created:**
- `app/src/client/components/BasicFilters.tsx` - Filter inputs component
- `app/tests/client/BasicFilters.test.tsx` - Component tests (12 tests)

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/client/hooks/useScreener.ts` - Added setFilters, filtersRef
- `app/src/client/App.tsx` - Integrated BasicFilters component

**Key Learnings:**
- Use `useRef` for values that need to be accessed in callbacks without re-creating them
- `filtersRef.current` allows executeScan to access current filters without re-render
- Clear button only shows when filters have values (conditional render)

**Filter Objects:**
```typescript
// priceMin: "50" → { field: "close", op: "gte", value: 50 }
// priceMax: "100" → { field: "close", op: "lte", value: 100 }
// volumeMin: "1000000" → { field: "volume", op: "gte", value: 1000000 }
```

**Tests (42 client tests total):**

## Backlog / Future Enhancements

### Sector/Industry Filtering (Sprint 4 extension)
**Priority:** High
**Reason:** User wants to filter stocks by category (e.g., technology stocks between $50-$250)

**Implementation:**
- TradingView API supports `sector` and `industry` fields
- Sectors include: Electronic Technology, Technology Services, Consumer Durables, Retail Trade, etc.
- Add multi-select dropdown to BasicFilters component
- Send sector filter to API: `{ field: "sector", op: "in", value: ["Electronic Technology", "Technology Services"] }`

**Data available:** Sector data already in `screener-service/data/tickers.json`


### Hybrid Filtering Approach (Future Enhancement)
**Priority:** Medium
**Reason:** Better UX for specific ticker scans

**Implementation:**
- For small ticker sets (<50): Fetch all data once, then filter client-side (instant filtering)
- For market-wide scans (>50): Use server-side filtering (handles large datasets)
- Could auto-detect based on ticker count or add a toggle

**Benefits:**
- Instant filter/column changes for small scans
- Still handles large market scans efficiently

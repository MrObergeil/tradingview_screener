## Project Setup

### Initial Planning (January 2025)

**Decisions Made:**
- Architecture: Python (FastAPI) + TypeScript (Fastify/React) hybrid
- Database: SQLite with better-sqlite3 (added in Phase B, not MVP)
- MVP approach: In-memory first, persistence later
- Development: Direct (no Docker), hot-reload enabled

**Key Documents:**
- `spec_v2.md` - Full specification with all requirements
- `tv-screener-implementation-plan.md` - Sprint-by-sprint implementation plan
- `planner.md` - Planning agent template (reference)

**Workflow:**
- PLAN MODE: Discuss approach before coding
- BUILD MODE: Implement after agreement
- Tests written per task
